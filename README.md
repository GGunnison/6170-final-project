Employ.Me
=========

##MVP Functionality

- simple search to find Students using tags  
  - only required tags apply  
  - weighting system not yet implemented  
- can create an account as a Student
- can create an account as an Employer
- Students can set tags for skills and classes

##Where to go from here  

- tags system needs to be completed
 - add in other aspects of a profile: sports, interests, etc.
- security
 - permissions for certain views and requests
 - Ensure that students have an MIT email
- UI redesign
- Student profile creation questonaire  
 

###Note: Do not register as an Employer and a Student with the same email! Our app does not support this, but we have not handled this edge case yet.
