##Where the app is at now
 - Backend is fully working for students and employer.
 - Ability to search from both an employer and a student.
 - Currently in the process of redesigning the homepage, so the feedback to the user is not entirely in place. (eg: when an email is already in use, user may not get visual feedback)

###For the next sprint  
- Handle improper formated requests better
- Finish the front end
  - Update student profile creation
  - Update employer profile creation
  - Add in updating of profiles
  - Redesign the home page
- Add messaging support, time permitting

### Tests
for the students: /tests/students  
for the employers: /tests/employers
