##MVP Functionality

- simple search to find Students using tags  
  - only required tags apply  
  - weighting system not yet implemented  
- can create an account as a Student

- tags system needs to be completed
 - add in other aspects of a profile: sports, interests, etc.
- security
 - permissions for certain views and requests
 - Ensure that students have an MIT email
- UI redesign
- Student profile creation questonaire  
- Might need fixing: Duplicate tags when skill and class tag
