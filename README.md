Employ.Me
=========


##Where the app is at now
 - Backend is fully working for students and employer  
 - Currently in the process of redesigning the homepage, so the feedback to the user is not entirely in place. (ex: when an email is already in use, user may not get visual feedback)
 - Ability to search from both an employer and a student.


###For the next sprint  
- Handle improper formated request better.  
- Finish the front end.  
  - update student profile creation
  - update employer profile creation
  - add in updating of profiles
  - redesign the home page
 - Add in message, time permitting.

### Tests
for the students: /tests/students  
for the employers: /tests/employers
